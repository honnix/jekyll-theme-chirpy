I mostly use streaming services nowadays to get music flowing in my home office, but I do have some
CDs that I cannot get content from any streaming service provider. My old portable Panasonic CD
player is dying and having hard time to read a disk. I thought about buying a new portable CD
player, but heck there is no good one to buy. I also thought about buying a proper CD player, but
the price tag pushed me back and I don't really have desktop space for that.

Instead, I ended up with a portable DVD drive, which is both slim and doing the job well. I plug it
into a USB switch (I'm using [this
one](https://www.ugreen.com/products/2-in-4-out-usb-3-0-sharing-switch-box), but anyone should just
be fine), so that I can easily switch the drive to connect to my work laptop or home PC. Sweet!

As a bonus, this is a DVD-RW drive, which means I can burn disk if I really need to.

Here is how it looks:
