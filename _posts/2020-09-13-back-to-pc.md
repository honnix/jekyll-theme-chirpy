老夫聊发少年狂，漫漫冬日无绝期，不如攒台机器玩。

The very first and last desktop PC I had was the one I built just before I entered college, which
was 20 years ago. Ever since then I have been sticking to laptop PC/Mac and desktop Mac. While all
my Macs had/have pretty OK performance, they cannot compare to a curated desktop PC.

It has been pretty boring these days due to `COVID-19` situation, so how about building a new
desktop to kill some time?

Here we go! This is my configuration:

* AMD Ryzen 9 3900x
* ASUS ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI)
* Samsung MZ-V7S500BW 970 EVO Plus 500GB
* G.Skill TridentZ Neo DDR4-3200 C16 DC 32GB
* GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER WindForce OC 4GB
* Corsair RM550x
* Fractal Design Meshify C TG White

I am not a big fan of heavy graphic gaming, so a decent graphic card that can drive my 4K monitor is
good enough. 1650 super does the job and it also has no problem driving a wide range of games.

CPU, memory and speedy SSD are all I need, so this configuration should keep me going for quite a
few years.

First thing first, all the components waiting to be assembled:

And when they are in the right place:

Next up, fire and get some OSes installed.

P.S. _I got another fun photo, aka `cloud computing`:_
