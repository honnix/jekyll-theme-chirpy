My old portable Panasonic CD player is dying and having hard time to read a disk. I thought about buying a new portable CD player, but heck there is no good one to buy. I also thought about buying a proper CD player, but the price... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Remap shortcuts</title><link href="https://honnix.com/posts/remap-shortcuts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Remap shortcuts" /><published>2020-11-22T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2020-11-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://honnix.com/posts/remap-shortcuts/</id> <content src="https://honnix.com/posts/remap-shortcuts/" /> <author> <name>Hongxin Liang</name> </author> <category term="Technology" /> <summary> Jumping back and forth between Mac and Linux is OK most of the time, but one the pain point has been keyboard shortcut. This is annoying when using Chrome, and is extremely annoying when copying things from Chrome to terminal (I configured Alt-C and Alt-V for copy&amp;amp;paste in gnome-terminal) or vice versa. xkeysnail is great and can easily remap shortcuts. However it is a bit cumbersome to u... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>PPA priority</title><link href="https://honnix.com/posts/ppa-priority/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PPA priority" /><published>2020-11-17T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2020-11-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://honnix.com/posts/ppa-priority/</id> <content src="https://honnix.com/posts/ppa-priority/" /> <author> <name>Hongxin Liang</name> </author> <category term="Technology" /> <summary> So I discovered this awesome theme. Installation was quite smooth and it looked gorgeous. But after sudo apt update, I found hundreds of packages to be upgraded. Weird. It turned out that the PPA contains not only the theme but also other packages for Pop!_OS. To prevent installing/upgrading other packages accidentally, I gave the PPA a lower priority: sudo tee &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF /etc/apt/preference... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Connect to Bluetooth earbuds with a keyboard shortcut</title><link href="https://honnix.com/posts/connect-to-bluetooth-earbuds-with-a-keyboard-shortcut/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Connect to Bluetooth earbuds with a keyboard shortcut" /><published>2020-11-13T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2020-11-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://honnix.com/posts/connect-to-bluetooth-earbuds-with-a-keyboard-shortcut/</id> <content src="https://honnix.com/posts/connect-to-bluetooth-earbuds-with-a-keyboard-shortcut/" /> <author> <name>Hongxin Liang</name> </author> <category term="Technology" /> <summary> For many reasons, I need to connect my earbuds to different computers from time to time. On Mac I can use Alfred + alfred+bluetooth-workflow, so convenient! To get similar experience on Linux, I did the following. First, install bluez if not already: sudo apt install bluez. Then find the earbuds address: bluetooth scan on or just do it once using gnome-control-center. Create a script with co... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Boot to Windows</title><link href="https://honnix.com/posts/boot-to-windows/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Boot to Windows" /><published>2020-10-22T00:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2020-10-22T00:00:00+02:00</updated> <id>https://honnix.com/posts/boot-to-windows/</id> <content src="https://honnix.com/posts/boot-to-windows/" /> <author> <name>Hongxin Liang</name> </author> <category term="Technology" /> <summary> Of course I default to boot into Linux. But the problem is, with a Bluetooth keyboard, it is simply not possible to navigate through Grub menu if I want to boot into Windows. There is a workaround that requires booting into Linux first! That is good enough for me because I spend most of the time in Linux and the boot process is lightening fast anyway. First, open /etc/default/grub and add/ch... </summary> </entry> </feed>
